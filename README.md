# About Me
I'm Emmanuel, a full-stack developer specializing in the development of distinctive, responsive websites and functional web applications. My coding journey began in 2018, and I honed my skills through resources such as freeCodeCamp and Harvard. Currently enrolled in a university program for Software Development, and when I'm not immersed in coding, you'll frequently discover me engaged in activities like gaming, cycling, or playing badminton.

*I'm always open to collaboration and small jobs, feel free to contact me at alabiemmanuel2937@gmail.com or on any of the socials listed below.*

# What I'm Currently Working On
Here are some of the projects I'm actively working on. Despite being a big enthusiast of open source, I like to hide my code while I'm still working on it, so as to not embarass it.
