## About Me
I'm Emmanuel, a full-stack developer specializing in the development of distinctive, responsive websites and functional web applications. My coding journey began in 2018, and I honed my skills through resources such as freeCodeCamp and Harvard. Currently enrolled in a university program for Software Development, and when I'm not immersed in coding, you'll frequently discover me engaged in activities like gaming, cycling, or playing badminton.

I'm always open to collaboration and small jobs, feel free to contact me at alabiemmanuel2937@gmail.com or on any of the socials listed below.
